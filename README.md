# DX8266

The DX8266 is a small, low power WiFi development board based around the ESP-12 module that i designed in my free time. Whith the goal being to test my own abilities at electronics and hardware design, and to make a simple board that is more complex and has more pins than the ESP-01, but simpler and more compact than the NodeMCU.
its basically a breakout board for the ESP-12, but a tiny bit spicier.

## to-do

- [ ] improve repo layout or something idk
- [ ] add diagrams and graphical schematics
- [ ] board usage tutorial
- [ ] improve the readme
