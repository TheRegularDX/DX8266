# DX8266

The DX8266 is a small, low power WiFi development board based around the ESP-12 module that i designed in my free time. Whith the goal being to test my own abilities at electronics and hardware design, and to make a simple board that is more complex and has more pins than the ESP-01, but simpler and more compact than the NodeMCU.
its basically just a small breakout board for the ESP-12.

## Getting started
plug it in with an usb to serial adapter lol 

## to-do

- [x] improve repo layout or something idk
- [ ] add diagrams and graphical schematics
- [x] add a board usage tutorial
- [ ] improve the readme and make it prettier
- [ ] add badges to the readme to make it look proffesional
      
## to-do for rev 2 board

- [ ] add pinout to the board so its usable without staring at the schematic
- [ ] make it breadboard compatible (how did i mess this up...)
- [ ] improve layout
- [ ] improve silkscreen logo
